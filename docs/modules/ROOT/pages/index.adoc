# Welcome to Yogurt

## Idea behind Yogurt

The Idea behind yogurt is to remove the pain of spice. Actually it is a way to even enjoy it much more.

Of course we are not talking about food. It is about proper software development. But actually the focus lies on linking data in documents.

Yogurt provides an easy option to create links in your documents, which are under version control and allows you to add attributes to the links. The result is a 100 %  flexibel process enabling tool. It can help you to realise any process you can think off.

## Plan

Create a initial implementation to provide basic features.
